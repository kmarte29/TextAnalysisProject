## Project Overview
This project is a Java-based text analysis tool designed to allow users to preprocess, analyze, and manage articles. The tool features an interactive, text-based user interface that enables folder management, article content addition, and advanced text analysis, including sentiment evaluation and vocabulary richness assessment.

---

### Features
1. **Folder Management**:
   - Create new folders dynamically within the base directory to organize articles.
   - Add `.txt` files to existing folders with custom content.

2. **Article Analysis**:
   - Analyze articles by selecting a topic (Baseball, Basketball, or Football).
   - Provides detailed output for each article, including:
     - Total words before and after removing stop words.
     - Count of positive and negative words.
     - Overall sentiment (Positive or Negative).
     - Vocabulary richness (unique word count).

3. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Uses `positive-words.txt` and `negative-words.txt` to assess the sentiment of articles.
   - Determines the overall sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on word counts.

4. **Improved User Experience**:
   - Features a user-friendly menu-driven interface.
   - Includes robust input validation and error handling for seamless use.

### Milestone 3 Enhancements
1. **Folder Creation**:
   - Users can dynamically create folders to organize articles by topics or categories.

2. **File Addition**:
   - Users can create new `.txt` files and add custom content through the program.

3. **Streamlined Analysis**:
   - Improved output for article statistics, including detailed sentiment analysis and vocabulary richness evaluation.

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Validates user inputs for directory paths, menu options, and text entry.
   - Notifies users of invalid actions or missing files.

---

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher installed.
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code).
- Basic knowledge of running Java programs in the command line or IDE.

---

### Running the Program
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kmarte29/TextAnalysisProject.git
   cd TextAnalysisProject

2. **Prepare the Environment**:
   - Ensure the base directory (/Users/krismarte/Documents/CPSC2231L/articles/) exists with subfolders:
     - `baseballArticle/` contains `.txt` files for Baseball-related articles.
     - `basketballArticle/` contains `.txt` files for Basketball-related articles.
     - `footballArticle/` contains `.txt` files for Football-related articles.

   The articles are automatically processed when you run the program.

3. **Stop Words and Sentiment Files**:
   - The stop words text file (`stopwords.txt`) is included in the repository.
   - Sentiment analysis uses two files: `positive-words.txt` and `negative-words.txt`, which are also included.

4. **Run the Program**:
   - Compile and run the `Article_Processor` class, either in your IDE or using the command line:
     ```bash
     javac Article_Processor.java
     java Article_Processor
     ```

### Menu Options

1. **Create a New Folder**:
   - Organize articles by creating a new folder in the base directory.
   - Example Workflow:
     - User is prompted to enter the name of the new folder.
     - The program validates if the folder already exists.
     - If the folder doesnâ€™t exist, it creates the folder and notifies the user.

2. **Add a File**:
   - Add a `.txt` file to an existing folder and populate it with custom content.
   - Example Workflow:
     - User is prompted to enter the name of the folder where the file will be added.
     - The program validates the existence of the folder.
     - User enters the name of the new `.txt` file.
     - The program creates the file and allows the user to input content, ending with the keyword `DONE`.

3. **Analyze Articles**:
   - Select a topic (Baseball, Basketball, or Football) to analyze articles within the corresponding folder.
   - Outputs include:
     - **Total Words**:
       - Number of words before and after removing stop words.
     - **Sentiment Analysis**:
       - Positive word count.
       - Negative word count.
       - Overall sentiment classification (Positive/Negative/Neutral).
     - **Vocabulary Richness**:
       - Ratio of unique words to total words.
   - Example Workflow:
     - User selects a topic (e.g., Baseball).
     - The program processes all `.txt` files in the topic's folder.
     - For each article, statistics and analysis are displayed in a structured format.

4. **Exit**:
   - Exits the program gracefully.
