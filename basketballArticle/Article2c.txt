The Boston Celtics are months removed from becoming NBA champions for an 18th time, after knocking off the Dallas Mavericks in five games in the 2024 NBA Finals.

But the path to another championship won't be a cakewalk, with a number of real contenders in both conferences. 

One of the Celtics' Eastern Conference foes made a few huge moves this offseason, with the Knicks acquiring Mikal Bridges from the Nets and re-signing OG Anunoby.

Then, another East foe, the Philadelphia 76ers, made waves by signing nine-time All-Star Paul George to a four-year max contract.

Along with George signing, the Sixers also inked franchise cornerstone Tyrese Maxey to a max extension, meaning the trio of George, Maxey and former NBA MVP Joel Embiid appear to be in it for the long haul.

In the West, the move that created the biggest shift near the top of the oddsboard was Oklahoma City's signing of center Isiah Hartenstein.

Here's a look at the NBA title odds at FanDuel Sportsbook as of Sept. 25.

At the top of July, the Sixers were tied with the Nuggets for the third-shortest odds to win the title. However, now it's Philly and New York tied at third.

Still, there will be questions about health when it comes to the Sixers, considering George has played 70-plus games just once in the past five seasons and Embiid has never played 70-plus games in a season.

In addition, Maxey missed 12 games last season and 22 in 2022-23.

As far as the West goes, the Thunder are second on the board, followed by a trio of contenders in Denver, Minnesota and Dallas, all at +1100.
